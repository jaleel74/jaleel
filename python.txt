 PYTHON:
it is developed by guido van rossum in the year 1991
its latest version is 3.12
it is high level programming language that is widely used in many tasks like web applications,software development,data analysis and software testing,AI & ML etc.,
it is easy to learn,efficient & can run on many different platforms

HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE:

it uses either compiler (OR) interpreter to translate the code

lOW LEVEL LANGUAGE:

uses assembler to translate

COMPILER :

it is a translator which is used to translate the code
it reads each & every line of code
ex: java

INTERPRETER :
line by line execution
 ex:python
USES OF PYTHON:
platform independent -- MAC,WINDOWS,LINUX,UBUNTU
simple syntax
runs as a interpreter
faster development
 
TERMINOLOGIES:
INDENTATION : SPACES
     if 5>2:
         printf("5 is greater than 2")
2. variables :containers -- stores the data/values
ex: a=10,b=20
3.comments : unexecuted lines of code 
 denoted by #
4. data types : types of input data
ex:a=10-- int
a= "jaleel"--string
a=4.5 -- float value
a=2+3i--complex
2= real,&3=imaginary values
boolean :ture(or) false
binary :byte

OPERATORS:
it is used to perform operations 
1.AIRTHEMATIC
2.LOGICAL
3.COMPARSION
4.ASSIGNMENT
5.IDENTITY
6.MEMBERSHIP
7.BITWISE OPERATORS

1.AIRTHEMATIC 
ADD:It is used sum 2 or more numbers
ex :a=100
    b=200
    sum =a+b
    print("sum of two numbers is :",sum)
sub :difference between 2 or morre numbers
ex:a=100
   b=20
   diff=a-b
   print("difference of two numbers iS :",diff)
multiplying: product of two or more numbers
ex: a=100
    b=2
    product=a*b
    print("product of two numbers is :",product)
divison :
ex :a=100
    b=20
    div=a/b
    print("divison of two numbers is :",div)
floor divison:
ex:a=100
   b=20
   fdiv=a/b
   print("floordivison of two numbers is :",fdiv)
modules:
ex:a=100
   b=20
   mod=a%b
   print("modules of two numbers is :",mod)
exponent:
ex:a=2
   b=3
   exp=a**b
   print("exponent of two numbers is :",exp)

2.LOGICAL
 AND :AND operator returns true if and only if both the inputs are "true" otherwise it returns "false"
  A   B   Y     
  T   T   T
  T   F   F        
  F   T   F        
  F   F   F 
EX:a =true
   b =true
   print(a and b)
 OR : OR operator returns true if any of the input is "true". it returns "false" if both the inputs       are"false"
  A   B   Y
  T   T   T
  T   F   T
  F   T   T
  F   F   F
EX: a=false
    b=true
    print(a or b)
 NOT : NOT operator makes our result as opposite 
  A   Y 
  T   F 
  F   T
EX: a=false
    print(not a)
3.COMPARISON
equals to (==):returns true if the left operand is equal to right operand
  ex: a=5
      print(a==5)
not equal to (!=):returns true if the left operand is not equal to right operand
ex: a=6
    print(a!=7)
greater than(>):returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand
ex:a=5 
   print(a>4)

lessthan(<):returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand
ex:a=5
   print(a<6)

greater than or equal to (>=):returns true if the left operand is greaterthan or equal to the right                                   operand
ex:a=5
   print(a>=5)

lessthan or equal to (<=):returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand
ex:a=6
   print(a<=7)
